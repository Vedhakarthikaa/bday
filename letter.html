      <h1>To Paulettan❤️</h1>

      <p>
        On this special day, I wish I could be there with you, saying all of this in person.
Since I can’t, I’ve put everything I wanted to say into this letter.<br>
I really wish we could be celebrating together.
I hope you know how much I love you and how grateful I am to have you in my life.
Thank you for being you.<br>
I’m always impressed by your hard work and dedication.<br> I know it isn’t easy to manage everything and still be there for everyone. So thank you for always finding time for me, no matter how small. It means more than you know.<br>
I know how hectic things get for you, and yet you handle everything perfectly. But I want you to remember to rest and take time for yourself too. If things ever feel overwhelming, I’m always here for you .<br>
I’m  proud of the person you are — kind, thoughtful, and considerate. You make others around you feel seen and loved. <br>Thank you for being the most selfless person.   You always try to do everything  you can to help someone in need — and even when there’s nothing you can do, I love that you include them in your prayers.
<br>
I miss you whenever you’re not near. I pray that you always stay this happy and blessed, no matter where you are.<br>
I wish I was there to hug you. Your hug makes everything better and makes me feel safe in your arms.<br> My heart still melts every time you smile. <br>
Also… I really hope you know CPR, because you keep turning me into a heart patient.<br>
Happy birthday to someone I never expected — but now can’t imagine my life without🤍.
